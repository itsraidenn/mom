Hi everyone. 

Hope you all are doing well.

The past year is one of those years that has brought me the most joy but also the most sadness. I found this community and in doing so have found some of my closest friends here. 

You may ask why I am here tonight, about to share my weakness and vulnerabilities with you all, its so hard for me right now after going through different stages of my life.

I am here tonight to ask for support. My mother has been diagnosed with cancer. She has given me the ultimate gift, the gift of life. She is the most brave, caring and kind hearted soul. It’s difficult to imagine they way she smiles till this day even though she has been through so much. She is the toughest person that I know, from raising her three kids in the patio of her parents house because she was too ashamed to tell her parents (my grandparents) that my father walked out. From being in an abusive relationship, to working 2 jobs for 8 years to provide for us. To never being able to take a vacation in her life because her sole purpose was turned into giving us a chance to live without struggle. 

As some of you may or may not know me but my name is Ronnie, I am 27 years old with a sister and a mother. I’ve been the sole provider for my family from the moment I was able to get a job. From putting my sister and my self through college to purchasing my grandparents house. My goal in life was always to retire my mom, However this came sooner than I expected, She had to quit her job to take care of my grandparents in the late term of their life. I took over the house and all expenses that came with this while given up most of my youth which I would do again.

My grandparents passed within 6 months of each other and my mother went into depression. Today however she still smiles more than anyone I know. I made a promise that I would forever take care of her and that is why I do what I do. My mother is only 49 years old has been diagnosed with rare, aggressive form of cancer called Acral Lentiginous Melanoma. 

What started as a small bruise/spot, which actually wasn’t a bruise but rather a tumor growing in her foot, has now started to spread and began to effect her organs. The current prognosis is that the early signs of stage 3 has begun. Treatments will be done at the regions only multi-specialty melanoma and cutaneous oncology program. The current plan is to perform surgery on her foot at the site to remove the tumor followed by series of targeted immunotherapy and systematic immunotherapy. During this time she won’t be able to bear any weight on her foot for at least 12 weeks. Treatments are expected to last at least a year or so followed by quarterly checkins for 5 years. After speaking with several doctors we are hopeful that she can beat this. She is the strongest person I know and I want to make sure she gets the best treatment possible. As of now, treatments & surgery are not covered under medicaid (except for breast and cervical cancer). 

The current estimated costs for the surgeries and treatments over the next several months are about $37,000-$45,000. This can change over the next several months/year after the initial surgery and treatments but I am hopeful that I can manage if it does. 

Asking for help is never easy, but I can already see that the road ahead is going to be a huge challenge for us. If you are able to contribute in any capacity during our time of need, we really appreciate it.
