Hi everyone. Hope you all are doing well. 

This year has brought me a great deal of both joy and sadness. I found this community and, in doing so, have met people that are now amongst my closest friends. More than anything, though, I’ve been inspired by the similarities I’ve seen between other people's story and my own. 

I am here tonight to share my weaknesses and vulnerabilities with you all. I hope, once you’ve heard what I have to say, you can understand how difficult it is for me to admit that I can’t do this alone. 

I am here tonight to ask for support. My mother has been diagnosed with cancer. 

She has given me the ultimate gift—the gift of life. She is the bravest, most caring, and kindhearted soul. I truly cannot understand how she smiles day after day despite having been through so much. She is also the toughest person I know. My mother raised her three kids in the patio of her parents’ house because she was too ashamed to tell her parents—my grandparents—that my father walked out. She was in an abusive relationship and worked two jobs for 8 years to provide for us. She was never, in her life, able to take a vacation because her sole purpose was to give us—her children—a chance to live without struggle. These experiences were the source of that toughness. 
Someday I may reflect on this moment as the source of my own mettle, but not tonight. 

Tonight, I am scared. 

For those of you who may not know me, I am 28 years old and, in addition to my mother, I have a younger sister. I’ve been the sole provider for my family from the moment I was able to get a job—I put my sister, as well as myself, through college and took charge of my grandparents’ house. My goal in life was always to help my mother retire. This, however, came sooner than I expected. She had to quit her job to take care of her parents in the late term of their lives. I took responsibility for the house and all expenses that came with it while sacrificing most of my youth, and I would do it again. 

My grandparents passed within 6 months of each other, and my mother fell into depression. Still, though, smiles more than anyone I know. I made a promise that I would forever take care of her and that is why I do what I do. 

My mother, who is only 49 years old, has been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called Acral Lentiginous Melanoma. What she thought was a small bruise was a tumor growing in her foot. The cancer has spread, and it is beginning to affect her organs. Currently, the doctors believe that her cancer is showing early signs indicative of stage 3. Treatments will take place at the region’s only multi-specialty melanoma and cutaneous oncology program. The current plan is to perform surgery on her foot at the site to remove the tumor. This operation will be followed by series of targeted immunotherapy and systematic immunotherapy treatments. During this time, she won’t be able to bear any weight on her foot for at least 12 weeks. 

These treatments, which she will undergo for at least a year, will be followed by quarterly check-ins for 5 years. After speaking with several doctors, we are hopeful that she can beat this. She is the strongest person I know, and I want to make sure she gets the best treatment possible. Currently, her surgery and the subsequent treatments will not be covered under Medicaid. 

The quoted costs will be in the range of $37,000-$45,000. This can change over the next year, after the initial surgery and treatments, and I can only hope that I can manage the expenses if they increase. 

Asking for help has never easy for me, as I’ve always pushed myself to overcome the many obstacles I’ve encountered in my life, but I can plainly see that the road ahead is going to be a huge challenge for my family.

If you are able to contribute in any capacity during our time of need we would greatly appreciate it.
